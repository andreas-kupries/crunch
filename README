Example command:

% ./process state ../../repo/tcl.fossil ./build_tcl ./build_ok build/tclsh ./save_check 

Taking it apart, as scripts are run.

==============================================
./process state ../../repo/tcl.fossil ./build_tcl ./build_ok build/tclsh ./save_check 

	Saves its state information to		state
	Operates (read-only) on fossil repo	 ../../repo/tcl.fossil

	Checks out all non-processed revisions, from the current tip
	descending into the past. Follows time, not parental linkage.

	Runs the following command on each revision.

	./build_tcl %repo% %uuid% %checkout% ./build_ok build/tclsh ./save_check

	%checkout% is the base directory for temp build state.
	Sub directory 'src' is where the revision is checked out into.

==============================================
./build_tcl %repo% %uuid% %checkout% ./build_ok build/tclsh ./save_check

	Looks for the sources in %checkout%/src
	Assumes that the sources are for revision %uuid%.
	Builds the sources, placing build state into

		%checkout%/build/build		build directory
		%checkout%/build/install	build destination, --prefix
		%checkout%/build/log		build log (configure, make)

	After each build, successful or not it calls

	./build_ok %repo% %uuid% %checkout% build/tclsh ./save_check

	to check if the build was succesful, or not.

==============================================
./build_ok %repo% %uuid% %checkout% build/tclsh ./save_check

	Looks for the sources in %checkout%/src
	Looks for the build in %checkout%/build

	Looks for the sentinel file

		%checkout%/build/build/tclsh

	If present, build is OK, otherwise FAIL.
	Calls

	./save_check %repo% %uuid% %checkout% %result%

	with this result.

==============================================
./save_check %repo% %uuid% %checkout% %result%

	Extends the file
		%checkout%/results/ok

	with a line listing %result% and %uuid%.
